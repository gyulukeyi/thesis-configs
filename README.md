# Configurations for Lee (To Appear)

What is included here are the `yaml` configuration files for my Master's Thesis, _HPSG/MRS-Based Natural Language Generation Using Transformer_. I'm submitting the thesis on Fall 2021, so it would be (hopefully) published in early 2022.

`experiment1.yaml` is the gold dataset only Transformer. `experiment2.yaml` is for the gold and silver datasets. `hajdik_replication.yaml` is for making the replica of [Hajdik et al. (2019)](https://github.com/shlurbee/dmrs-text-generation-naacl2019). 

Since the data and its preprocessors are developed by Hajdik and others, visit [their repository](https://github.com/shlurbee/dmrs-text-generation-naacl2019) for data and preparation. For the implementation, I used [OpenNMT-py Release 2.0.0rc2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/releases/tag/2.0.0rc2). That is commit `f12dd51f8750acc91c190e7962439ce4daf2f28c` of the project. 

For the more implementation detail, please refer to Chapter 5.1.2 of my thesis.

The thesis will be uploaded here as well once it is accepted and publicly available.
